# Todo-App-using-API
I made an Online Todo APp using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I implemented the project using fetch api.

fetch button - calls todo api and displays tasks.
show all - shows the tasks that are stored locally after first fetch call. 
show completed -- shows completed tasks
show pending -- shows incomplete tasks
